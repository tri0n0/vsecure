# üöÄ Snort HIDS in WSL2

## üìö About
This project implements a **Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS)** using **Snort** within a **WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux v2)** environment.  
It builds upon existing research, identifies modern gaps, and proposes a lightweight security solution for virtualized Linux systems on Windows.

## üß† Key Features
- **HIDS Adaptation in WSL2**  
  Deploy and optimize Snort in a virtualized Linux environment inside Windows.
- **Nmap Scanning Techniques & Detection**  
  Identify and detect various scanning methods used by attackers.
- **Log Analysis & Alerting**  
  Analyze logs and configure real-time alerts for suspicious activities.
- **Windows Firewall & Resource Management**  
  Handle WSL2 networking challenges and optimize for performance.
- **Research Gap & Contribution**  
  Focused on the lack of lightweight IDS research for WSL2 environments.

## üéØ Objective
To show that an effectively tuned HIDS like Snort can:
- Work efficiently under WSL2's resource constraints.
- Detect evolving cyber threats in hybrid environments.
- Serve as a model for lightweight IDS deployments in future virtual systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation (Optional Section if you want)
```bash
# Install Snort in your WSL2 environment
sudo apt update
sudo apt install snort
# Configure Snort rules and logging paths
```

‚úÖ **Pro Tip:**  
- Add badges later (like "Build Passing", "License", etc.) for even cleaner GitHub presentation.
- Pin this README in your repo so people immediately know what it's about.
